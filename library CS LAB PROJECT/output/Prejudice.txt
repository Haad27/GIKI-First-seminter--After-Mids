PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

Silly Mrs. Bennet is “husband hunting”
for her five daughters. Heaven knows it
isn’t easy! Darcy would make a great
match for Elizabeth—if it weren’t for his
false pride and her stubborn prejudice.
And the other girls aren’t cooperating,
either. Jane is too shy to show affection, and
Lydia has run off with an unsuitable army
officer! What’s a poor mother to do?

A New
Neighbor

There is one truth that most women agree
upon: A young, single man with a good
income must be needing a wife.
When such a young man moves into a
neighborhood, he may not be aware of his
need for a wife. But his neighbors are well
aware of it. In fact, he is considered the
property of one or another of their daughters.
Mrs. Bennet had heard the nearby estate,
Netherfield Park, had just been rented. She
was very eager to tell her husband.
“My dear Mr. Bennet, Netherfield Park
has been rented at last!” his wife announced.
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
“Do you not want to know who has taken
it?” she asked impatiently.

“You want to tell me,” Mr. Bennet said,
“and I have no objection to hearing it.”
“His name is Bingley,” Mrs. Bennet said.
“He is a single man with a large fortune—
four or five thousand a year! What a fine
opportunity for our girls!”
“How so?” Mr. Bennet inquired. “How
can it affect them?”
“Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet!” his wife cried.
“How can you be so tiresome? You must know
what I am thinking. Perhaps he will marry
one of them. You must call on him just as
soon as he arrives.”
“I see no reason for that,” Mr. Bennet said.
“Mr. Bennet, you seem to take delight in
provoking me. You have no compassion for
my poor nerves,” his wife complained.
“You mistake me, my dear,” Mr. Bennet
chuckled. “I have nothing but the highest
respect for your nerves. I’ve heard you talk
about them for 20 years at least.”
Mr. Bennet was an odd mixture of reserve
and sarcastic humor. His poor wife didn’t
understand him. Her mind, however, was less
difficult to understand. She knew little and

understood little. The business of her life was
to get her five daughters married.
Mr. Bennet, in fact, was one of the first to
visit Mr. Bingley. He revealed this news one
evening when his second oldest daughter,
Elizabeth, was decorating a hat. “I hope Mr.
Bingley will like it,” he said quietly.
His wife sighed. “I’m afraid we shall never
know what Mr. Bingley likes. In fact, I am
sick of Mr. Bingley.”
“Why did you not tell me so before?” Mr.
Bennet said. “I wouldn’t have visited him.”
His family’s astonishment was just what he
had wished! His daughters, Jane, Elizabeth,
Mary, Catherine, and Lydia, were speechless.
And Mrs. Bennet was the most surprised of
all. But she pretended that she knew all along
her husband would visit Mr. Bingley.
To the Bennet family’s delight, Mr.
Bingley attended the next ball. With him, he
brought his two sisters, the husband of the
eldest sister, and another young man.
Mr. Bingley was a good-looking man. His
manners were easy and unaffected. His sisters
were fine, fashionable women. His brother7

in-law, Mr. Hurst, looked like an average
gentleman. But his friend Mr. Darcy drew
most of the attention. He was tall, handsome,
and noble-looking. Within five minutes of his
arrival, almost everyone knew he had an
income of ten thousand a year. For half the
evening, everyone admired him. Then their
feelings turned to disgust, for they discovered
what a proud fellow he was.
While Bingley danced every dance, Mr.
Darcy mostly stood alone. At one point,
Bingley urged his friend to join in the fun.
Elizabeth Bennet was nearby. She
overheard their conversation. Since there were
few men to dance with, she was sitting down.
“Come, Darcy!” Bingley urged his friend.
“I must insist that you dance.”
“I certainly shall not!” Darcy said. “Your
sisters have other partners, and you are
dancing with the only pretty girl in the
room.” He looked over at Jane Bennet.
“Oh, yes! She is the most beautiful girl I
ever saw!” Bingley agreed. “But her younger
sister, Elizabeth, is sitting down just behind
you. She is very pretty, too.”

Darcy turned and studied Elizabeth for a
moment. “She is tolerable,” he said coldly,
“but not pretty enough to tempt me.”
After the men walked off, Elizabeth told
her friends the story with great spirit. She had
a lively, playful personality. She loved to laugh
and make others laugh, too.
After the ball, Jane and Elizabeth were
talking. Jane confessed that she liked Mr.
Bingley a great deal.
“I was very flattered that he asked me to
dance a second time,” Jane told her sister. “I
9

didn’t dare to expect such a compliment.”
“Did you not?” Elizabeth asked. “I did.
Well, he seems very agreeable, so I’m pleased
that you like him. Heaven knows, you’ve liked
many a stupider person.”
“Lizzy!” Jane protested.
Elizabeth smiled. “Oh, you never see a
fault in anybody,” she said. “In all my life, I’ve
never heard you speak ill of a single human
being! You have good sense—but you are
blind to the nonsense of others.”
Back at Netherfield Park, Darcy and
Bingley also discussed the ball. Bingley said
he had never met more pleasant people in his
life. And as for Miss Jane Bennet, he couldn’t
imagine an angel more beautiful! Darcy, on
the other hand, had no interest in anyone at
the ball. He agreed that Jane Bennet was very
pretty—but he thought she smiled too much.
The two friends had very different
characters. Darcy admired his friend’s easiness
and openness. Bingley valued Darcy’s opinion
and judgment. Darcy was well-bred, but stiff.
His manners were not inviting, and he often
offended people. Bingley was very popular.

The Lucas family lived quite near the
Bennets. Sir William Lucas had made a great
fortune in trade. He’d even been knighted!
After receiving this honor, however, he’d given
up business entirely.
Lady Lucas was an especially good kind of
woman. Charlotte, her oldest daughter, was
sensible and intelligent. She was also a close
friend of Elizabeth Bennet’s.
The morning after the ball, the Bennets
and the Lucases were gathered at Lucas
Lodge. Everyone had something to say about
Mr. Darcy’s behavior.
“His pride doesn’t offend me as pride often
does,” Charlotte said. “He’s a fine young man,
with family and fortune—he has a right to be
proud!”
“I could easily forgive his pride,” said
Elizabeth, “if he had not mortified mine.”
“If I were you, Lizzy,” her mother said, “I
would not dance with him ever.”
“I believe, ma’am, I can promise I shall
never dance with him!” Elizabeth assured her.

Hall

The more Mr. Bingley saw of Jane, the
more he seemed to like her. As for Jane,
Elizabeth could tell that her sister was falling
in love. But Elizabeth was pleased to see that
Jane refused to show her feelings. That would
keep her safe from the suspicions and teasing
of others. Elizabeth mentioned this to
Charlotte Lucas.
“It’s not always good to be so guarded,”
Charlotte said. “If a woman hides her
affection, she may lose the man she likes.”
“Jane does help him on—as much as her
nature will allow,” Elizabeth explained. “But
whenever she sees him, it’s in a large party.
She really doesn’t know his character well.”
“Of course,” Charlotte said, “I wish Jane
success with all my heart. But happiness in
marriage is a matter of chance. I believe it is
12

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

09/6/06

Page 13

better to know as little as possible about the
faults of the person you marry.”
Elizabeth smiled. “You make me laugh,
Charlotte. You’d never act that way yourself.”
Whenever Bingley was with her sister,
Elizabeth watched closely. Meanwhile, there
was one thing she failed to notice: Mr. Darcy
was becoming interested in her.
The next time Darcy saw Elizabeth was at
Lucas Lodge. Several couples were dancing at
one end of the room.
Sir William Lucas remarked to Mr. Darcy,
“There’s nothing like dancing! I believe it’s
one of the true signs of fine society.”
“Dancing is also popular in less fine
societies,” Darcy said. “Every savage can dance.”
Just then, Elizabeth was moving in their
direction. “Mr. Darcy,” Sir William said,
“you must allow me to present this young lady
to you. She’s a perfect dancing partner.”
Sir William took Elizabeth’s hand and was
about to offer it to Mr. Darcy. But she
instantly drew back.
“Indeed, sir,” she said quickly. “I don’t
have the least intention of dancing.”
13

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

When Mr. Darcy asked her if she would
dance, Elizabeth politely refused and turned
away. They didn’t speak again for the rest of
the evening.
But Mr. Darcy was to see Elizabeth again
soon—in an unexpected manner.
One morning, Jane was invited by
Bingley’s sisters, Caroline and Louisa, to dine
with them that evening.
Jane asked her mother for the carriage.
“No, my dear,” her mother answered. “You
had better go on horseback. It looks like it
will rain, and then you can stay all night.”
In fact, it rained hard that day. Jane was
completely wet by the time she arrived. She
spent the night at Netherfield Hall and was
very ill when she woke up.
Hearing this, Mr. Bennet teased his wife.
“Well, my dear,” he said, “if your daughter
should die, at least it will be for a good cause!”
“Oh, people do not die of little colds!”
Mrs. Bennet said in an irritated voice.
Elizabeth was worried, however. The
family carriage was not available, and she was
not a horsewoman. But she was determined to
14

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

09/6/06

Page 15

see her sister, so she decided to walk.
“We’ll go as far as Meryton with you,”
Catherine and Lydia volunteered. Elizabeth
knew that a militia regiment had recently
arrived in the nearby town of Meryton. It
happened that their aunt and uncle, the
Philipses, lived there. Lately, Catherine and
Lydia had talked of nothing but officers.
At Meryton, Elizabeth said goodbye to her
sisters and went on alone. She arrived at
Netherfield Hall with muddy stockings. Her
face was glowing with the warmth of exercise.
Poor Jane was indeed ill with fever and
headache. When Elizabeth was also invited to
stay, she accepted gratefully. A servant was
sent to tell the Bennet family of her plans,
and to bring back a supply of clothes.
At half past six, Elizabeth was called to
dinner. Everyone asked about Jane’s health.
Young Bingley seemed truly worried about
Jane. Elizabeth warmed to his kindness.
When dinner was over, Elizabeth returned
to Jane’s side. As soon as she was out of the
room, Mrs. Hurst said, “I shall never forget
Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s appearance this
15

Page 16

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

morning. She actually looked almost wild.”
Caroline agreed. “Why should she even
come here? Why go scampering about the
country just because her sister has a cold? And
looking so untidy, too!”
“Your image may be correct,” Bingley said,
“but this was all lost on me. I thought Miss
Elizabeth Bennet looked wonderfully well this
morning. To me, coming here shows a deep
affection for her sister.”
“I think very highly of Jane Bennet,” Mrs.
Hurst said. “She’s really a very sweet girl. I
wish with all my heart that she was well
married. But with such a family—and such
low connections—I’m afraid there’s no chance
of it!”
“I’ve heard that their uncle, Mr. Philips, is
a lawyer in Meryton,” Caroline said.
Mrs. Hurst snickered. “Yes, and I believe
they have another, somewhere in London,
near Cheapside!”
Both sisters laughed.
Bingley looked annoyed. “If they had
uncles enough to fill all of Cheapside, it
would make no difference to me!”
16

Darcy said, “But surely you must agree,
Bingley, that it hurts their chances of
marrying well.”
To this Bingley made no answer.
The next morning, Mrs. Bennet, along
with Catherine and Lydia, came to visit Jane.
Mrs. Bennet’s behavior embarrassed
Elizabeth completely. First she boasted about
Jane’s beauty and good nature. Then she
insulted Mr. Darcy. She compared him to Sir
William Lucas, whom she said was far
friendlier!
After seeing Jane, Mrs. Bennet announced
that her daughter was too ill to be moved. She
was happy to have Jane stay. Elizabeth
groaned. She was eager to have her sister
well—and even more eager to leave!

A Visitor
Arrives

That evening, Jane was well enough to
leave her room for a few hours. Bingley made
sure the fire was well built up before he sat
down by her. Elizabeth was delighted to see
that he hardly spoke to anyone else.
While Jane and Bingley talked, Darcy took
up a book. Caroline Bingley did the same—
but she secretly spent most of the time
watching Mr. Darcy read. Mrs. Hurst played
with her rings and bracelets. Now and then
she joined in her brother’s conversation with
Jane. Mr. Hurst went to sleep.
After a while, Caroline gave a great yawn
and said, “How pleasant it is to spend a quiet
evening reading!”
No one answered her. She yawned again
and began walking about the room. Although
her figure was elegant, Darcy didn’t look up
18

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

09/6/06

2:48 PM

Page 19

from his book. Then she invited Elizabeth to
walk about the room with her.
Now Darcy looked up. Without knowing
what he was doing, he closed his book.
Caroline invited him to join them, but he
politely refused. He said it would interfere
with their purpose.
“What do you mean by that?” Caroline
demanded.
“Because you want to show off your figures
by walking,” Darcy answered. “I can see you
much better sitting by the fire.”
“Oh, how shocking!” Caroline cried out.
“How shall we punish him?”
“Tease him—laugh at him,” Elizabeth
suggested quietly.
“No,” Caroline said. “It is impossible to
laugh at Mr. Darcy.”
“Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at?”
Elizabeth asked mockingly. “So he has no
faults at all?”
“Oh, I don’t believe that’s possible for
anyone,” Darcy said. “But all of my life I’ve
tried to avoid faults that others might find
laughable.”

“Such as vanity and pride,” Elizabeth said.
“Yes,” Darcy agreed. “Vanity is a fault
indeed. But pride—when one’s mind is truly
superior—that is not a fault.”
Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.
Then she said, “I am convinced then. You
must truly have no faults at all.”
“Oh, but I do!” Mr. Darcy said. “I cannot
forget or forgive the follies and vices of
others. If I lose my good opinion of someone,
it is lost forever.”
“Yes, that is a fault indeed!” Elizabeth
retorted. “But you have chosen your defect well.
It really isn’t laughable. It seems that your defect
makes it easy for you to hate everybody.”
“Your fault,” Darcy said with a smile, “is
to misunderstand them.”
Caroline was impatient. “Now let’s have a
little music!” she said. She was tired of a
conversation in which she had no share.
When the pianoforte was opened, Darcy
was relieved. He felt more attracted to
Elizabeth than he ever wanted to. If it weren’t
for her low connections, he feared that he
could fall in love with her!
20

The next day, Caroline teased him about
paying so much attention to Elizabeth. When
Jane was well enough to travel on Sunday,
Darcy was relieved to see Elizabeth leave.
Later, when the whole Bennet family was
together again, Mr. Bennet announced a
surprise. A young man, a stranger, was
coming to visit for several days. “The visitor is
my cousin, Mr. Collins,” Mr. Bennet
explained. “This is the gentleman who will
inherit our home when I’m dead. He may
turn you all out of the house if he likes.”
“Oh!” Mrs. Bennet cried out. “Please don’t
even mention that horrid man! It’s dreadful
that our home will not be passed on to your
own children. How unfair that the property
can only be passed on to male heirs!”
“I agree. It is certainly most unfair,” Mr.
Bennet said. “But if you’ll listen to the letter
he sent me, perhaps you’ll forgive him a
little.” The letter read:
Dear Sir:
The disagreement between yourself and my
father has always made me unhappy. Now that
21

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

Page 22

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

he has gone, I feel that it is my duty to make
peace between our families. I never wished to
hurt your daughters. Indeed, I am ready to make
amends.
William Collins
The peacemaking Mr. Collins arrived at
four o’clock. He was a tall, overweight young
man. His manners were very formal.
Mr. Collins had been raised by an illiterate
and stingy father. He had begun life
humbly—but he had been lucky. He’d been
given a living by Lady Catherine de Bourge,
who lived in Kent. His new rank in life made
him a mixture of pride and modesty. With the
gift of “a living,” he received a home, land,
and appointment as the religious leader of the
local church.
At dinner, Mr. Collins talked at great
length about Lady Catherine. No praise was
too high for her. He took pride in paying her
many delicate compliments.
“Do these compliments come from the
impulse of the moment?” Mr. Bennet asked.
“Or do you think of them beforehand?”
22

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

09/6/06

2:48 PM

Page 23

A Visitor Arrives • 3

“Oh, I often spend my time thinking up
elegant little compliments,” Mr. Collins said.
“They’re useful for many occasions.”
Mr. Bennet smiled. He found Mr. Collins
completely absurd. Now he was enjoying
himself thoroughly.
Mr. Collins’ motive for making amends to
his cousins soon became clear. He intended to
marry one of them! Jane was his first choice—
until Mrs. Bennet hinted that Jane was likely
to be engaged soon.
In that case, he settled on Elizabeth. Mrs.
Bennet was delighted! She never dreamed that
she might have two daughters married soon!
The man she’d called “horrid” the day before
was now high in her good graces.
The next day, Mr. Collins walked with his
cousins to Meryton. All along the way, he
delivered pompous remarks. His polite
cousins agreed with everything he said. As
they reached Meryton, however, Lydia and
Catherine began looking up and down the
streets in search of officers. They spotted an
officer they knew, Mr. Denny, walking with a
stranger. Mr. Denny introduced them to a
23

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

09/6/06

2:48 PM

Page 24

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

man named Mr. Wickham, who’d recently
joined their corps.
Mr. Wickham was completely charming.
He had a handsome face, a slender body, and
pleasing manners. The whole party was
chatting very agreeably when they heard the
hoofbeats of horses. Darcy and Bingley were
coming down the street!
Bingley greeted Jane happily. He’d been on
his way to the house to ask about her health.
Darcy bowed to the party. Determined not to
fix his eyes on Elizabeth, he suddenly noticed
the stranger. Elizabeth happened to see Darcy
and Wickham exchange surprised glances.
Darcy’s face had turned red, and Wickham’s
had turned white!
What could be the meaning of it?
Elizabeth wondered. It was impossible to
imagine. And it was just as impossible not to
wonder about!

Wickham’s
Story

The very next day, Elizabeth discovered
the connection between Mr. Darcy and Mr.
Wickham. She and her sisters, along with Mr.
Collins, had been invited to the Philipses’ for
supper and cards. Mr. Wickham had also been
invited. The story Wickham told Elizabeth
was quite shocking!
When they were alone, Wickham spoke
out. “Elizabeth, you might have noticed the
very cold manner of my meeting with Mr.
Darcy yesterday. Do you know him well?”
“I know him as well as I ever wish to,”
Elizabeth said. “I find him very disagreeable.”
“I’ve known Mr. Darcy a great many
years,” Wickham explained. “My dear father
managed Pemberly, the Darcy property. We
grew up in the same house. Mr. Darcy’s father
was a great man—the truest friend I ever had!
25

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

When my own father died, Darcy’s father
promised to help me. In his will, he left me a
valuable living. But his son made sure it was
given to another man.”
“Good heavens!” Elizabeth cried out. “But
how could he go against the will? Did you not
seek help from a lawyer?”
“I’m afraid the will was very informal,”
Wickham explained. “There was no hope of
going to a lawyer.”
“How shocking!” Elizabeth protested.
“Darcy deserves to be publicly disgraced.”
Wickham frowned. “He will be, some time
or other—but not by me,” he said. “I care too
much for his father’s memory.”
“I never liked Mr. Darcy,” Elizabeth said.
“But I didn’t think him so bad as this.”
“Oh, Mr. Darcy does have some good
qualities,” Mr. Wickham went on. “He gives
his money quite freely to the poor. And he’s a
very thoughtful guardian of his sister. He can
be kind when he chooses. But his pride is
always with him.”
Just then, their quiet conversation was
interrupted by Mr. Collins’ loud voice. He
26

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

09/6/06

Page 27

was saying something about Lady Catherine
de Bourge.
Wickham asked Elizabeth if she knew that
Lady Catherine was Mr. Darcy’s aunt.
“No, indeed, I did not,” Elizabeth said.
“Her daughter is expected to inherit a
very large fortune,” Wickham went on. “Lady
Catherine expects her to marry Mr. Darcy.”
Elizabeth smiled at the thought of poor
Caroline Bingley. All of her attentions to Mr.
Darcy had been in vain!
On the way home, she could think of
nothing but what Mr. Wickham had told her.
When she told Jane, her sister was upset. Yet
Jane could not believe ill of Wickham nor
Darcy. She insisted there must have been
some mistake. Elizabeth, however, was
convinced of Darcy’s cruelty.
Elizabeth’s dislike of Mr. Darcy grew. Two
days later, Mr. Bingley gave a ball at
Netherfield. Elizabeth arrived in high spirits.
She looked around the room eagerly, hoping
to find Mr. Wickham. Instead, Mr. Denny
told her that his friend wasn’t coming. He had
no desire to see Mr. Darcy.
27

While she was talking to Charlotte, Mr.
Darcy asked Elizabeth to dance. She was so
surprised that she said yes!
For some time they danced in silence.
Finally, Elizabeth couldn’t resist talking about
Mr. Wickham. She told Mr. Darcy that they’d
become friends.
Mr. Darcy looked uncomfortable. “Mr.
Wickham makes friends very easily. It isn’t
certain whether he can keep them or not.”
“He was certainly unlucky to lose your
friendship,” Elizabeth said. “He’s likely to
suffer all his life because of it!”
Darcy made no answer. When the dance
finished, they parted in silence.
Elizabeth looked around for Jane, who’d
been dancing with Bingley. Jane was glowing
when they met. Reading her feelings,
Elizabeth was filled with hope for her.
“Tell me, Jane,” Elizabeth said. “Have you
learned anything more about Mr. Wickham?”
“Mr. Bingley doesn’t know the whole
story,” Jane said. “But he’s convinced of Mr.
Darcy’s honor. Both he and his sister believe
that Mr. Wickham is not respectable.”

“But Mr. Bingley himself doesn’t even
know Mr. Wickham,” Elizabeth said.
“No, he never even saw him until the other
morning at Meryton,” Jane agreed.
“I don’t doubt Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,”
Elizabeth went on. “But surely he doesn’t
know the entire story! My opinion of Mr.
Darcy and Mr. Wickham is the same.”
The rest of the evening was not pleasant.
When Mr. Collins spoke to Mr. Darcy
without being introduced, he made a fool of
himself. During supper, Mrs. Bennet spoke
long and loudly to Lady Lucas. The subject
was Jane and Bingley—that they would
probably be married soon. When Elizabeth
begged her mother to lower her voice, Mrs.
Bennet scolded her.
Then, Elizabeth’s youngest sister, Mary,
sang for the guests. Mary’s voice was weak and
her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies
of embarrassment.
The next day at the Bennets’ house was
even more embarrassing. Elizabeth had
guessed that Mr. Collins might propose to
her—and she was correct. After breakfast, he
29

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

asked to speak to her alone.
Mr. Collins was blushing. “Almost as soon
as I entered this house, I singled you out as
my future wife,” he said. “Let me assure you
that your lack of fortune will be no obstacle
to our happiness. When we are married, dear
Elizabeth, I shall never blame you for it.”
“But you are too hasty, sir,” Elizabeth
interrupted. “You forget that I have made no
answer. Please accept my thanks for the
compliment you are paying me. I am honored
by your offer. But it is quite impossible for me
to accept.”
Mr. Collins waved his hand formally. “I
know it is usual with young ladies to say no at
first. Therefore, I am not discouraged at all.”
“Upon my word, sir,” Elizabeth stated
firmly. “I am not one of those young ladies. I
am perfectly serious.”
“My dearest cousin,” Mr. Collins went on,
“forgive me if I do not believe you. My situation
in life is excellent. My connection with Lady
Catherine makes my offer a handsome one. In
spite of your many attractions, a poor girl like
you may never get another offer of marriage.

Therefore, I believe you mean to make my
love stronger by suspense.”
The situation was impossible! Not
knowing what else to do, Elizabeth left the
room. A few minutes later, she was called to
the library. Her parents were waiting for her.
“I hear you have refused Mr. Collins,” her
father said. “Is that true, Elizabeth?”
“Yes, sir,” Elizabeth admitted.
Mr. Bennet spoke in a grave voice. “Your
mother insists that you accept him. Is this not
so, Mrs. Bennet?”
“Yes—or I will never see her again!” Mrs.
Bennet whimpered.
Mr. Bennet looked stern. “You have an
unhappy choice before you, Elizabeth,” he
said. “Your mother will never see you again if
you do not marry Mr. Collins. But I will
never see you again if you do!”
“Mr. Bennet! ” his wife cried out. Elizabeth
couldn’t help but smile.

Jane’s
Disappointment

Mr. Collins’ feelings for Elizabeth were
imaginary. Only his pride was hurt by her
refusal. But the house was in an uproar. Mrs.
Bennet was full of complaints and bad humor.
When Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day,
the entire family was relieved. Charlotte was
very kind to Mr. Collins. She listened quietly
to everything he had to say.
The next day, a letter was delivered to
Jane. Elizabeth watched her read it, and saw
her face fall. When they were alone, Jane said,
“It’s from Caroline Bingley. They’ve all left for
London and may not be back this winter. I’ll
read you the part that hurts me most:
“Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister, and
so are we all, I must say. Georgiana Darcy has
no equal for beauty and elegance. My brother
already likes her very much. We do hope to call
32

her our sister someday soon.
“Is this not clear enough, dear Lizzy?” Jane
cried out. “Caroline makes it plain she doesn’t
expect me to be her sister. She must be sure
her brother cares little for me. Can there be
any other meaning to what she writes?”
“Yes, there can,” Elizabeth said. “Perhaps
Caroline sees that her brother’s in love with
you. Perhaps she’s the one who wants him to
marry Miss Darcy. She’s trying to convince
you that her brother does not care for you.”
Jane shook her head miserably.
“Jane, try to believe me,” Elizabeth said.
“No one can doubt his feelings for you. But
the case is this: We’re not rich enough or
grand enough for them. Therefore, she’s
anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother.”
“I know we don’t agree on Caroline’s
character,” Jane said. “But she’s not capable of
deception. She’s just mistaken.”
“Believe what you will,” Elizabeth said.
“But worry no longer.”
The Bennets had agreed to dine with the
Lucases. Again, Charlotte listened endlessly
to Mr. Collins. There was a motive behind her
33

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

09/6/06

2:48 PM

Page 34

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

kindness. She was hoping that Mr. Collins
would turn his interest from Elizabeth to
herself. When they parted, Charlotte felt
hopeful of success—and she was.
Early the next morning, Mr. Collins
hurried over to Lucas Lodge. There, he
declared his love to Charlotte. Everything was
quickly settled, and Sir William and Lady
Lucas were joyful.
Charlotte herself was pleased. She knew, of
course, that Mr. Collins was neither sensible
nor agreeable. His feelings for her were
34

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

09/6/06

2:48 PM

Page 35

Jane’s Disappointment • 5

probably imaginary. But still, he would be her
husband. In truth, Charlotte didn’t think
highly of men or marriage. Yet marriage was
the only honorable situation for a woman
with little money. She was 27 years old and
had never been pretty. To her, Mr. Collins’
proposal was great good luck. Her only worry
was telling Elizabeth her news.
“You’re engaged to Mr. Collins!” Elizabeth
exclaimed. “My dear Charlotte—impossible! ”
Then Elizabeth pulled herself together and
quickly wished her friend much happiness.
“I know what you are feeling,” Charlotte
said. “But when you take time to think it
over, you’ll understand. I’m not a romantic,
you know. I believe my chance of happiness is
as good as most people’s.”
Elizabeth politely agreed—but she was not
convinced. Dear Charlotte, as the wife of Mr.
Collins, was a most humiliating picture!
When Mrs. Bennet heard of Charlotte’s
engagement, she was extremely upset. Days
went by before she could see Elizabeth
without scolding her. Weeks passed before she
could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas
35

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

09/6/06

2:48 PM

Page 36

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

without being rude. And many months had
gone by before she finally forgave Charlotte.
Meanwhile, Bingley had been away for
several weeks. Not a word had been heard
from him. Jane was quiet on the subject.
Whatever she was feeling, she didn’t wish to
discuss. But it was a different matter with
their mother. She talked about Mr. Bingley
constantly, impatient for his return.
At last a letter from Caroline Bingley put
an end to their doubts. She said they were
settled in London for the winter. Elizabeth
heard the news in silent indignation. She
didn’t believe Caroline’s hints that her brother
was falling in love with Miss Darcy. But she
was angry with Bingley’s weakness. How
could his friends influence him so easily?
Jane was sure now that Bingley had never
loved her. She couldn’t believe Darcy and
Bingley’s sisters were scheming against her.
Suspicion was not in her nature.
In this gloomy period, Mr. Wickham was
the family’s one comfort. They saw him often.
It soon became clear that he preferred
Elizabeth to anyone else. Now he told
36

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

09/6/06

2:48 PM

Page 37

Jane’s Disappointment • 5

everyone how badly Darcy had treated him.
Everyone was pleased to think how they had
disliked Darcy from the beginning.
At Christmas, Mrs. Bennet’s brother and
his wife came to visit. Mr. Gardiner was a
sensible, well-bred man—greatly superior to
his sister. Mrs. Gardiner was likable and
intelligent. She was a favorite with the Bennet
girls, especially Elizabeth and Jane.
Elizabeth told her aunt Bingley and Jane’s
entire story. “Oh, poor Jane!” Mrs. Gardiner
said. “She won’t get over it quickly. It would
have been better if it had happened to you,
Lizzy. You would have laughed yourself out of
it sooner. Jane should come to London with
us. A change of scene might help.”
Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased. Jane
accepted her aunt’s invitation with pleasure.
Knowing that Bingley didn’t live in the same
house as his sisters, she could visit Caroline
without any danger of seeing him.

Elizabeth
Visits Charlotte

Mrs. Gardiner saw that Elizabeth liked
Wickham very much. She gave her niece some
kindly advice. “Lizzy,” she said, “you must be
on your guard with Wickham. I have nothing
to say against him. If he had the fortune he
ought to have, you couldn’t do better. But as
it is—please don’t let your fancy run away
with you! Don’t disappoint your father.”
“At present, I am not in love with Mr.
Wickham,” Elizabeth answered. “But he is the
most agreeable man I ever met. And if he does
really become attached to me—but it would
be better if he did not! Oh, that abominable
Mr. Darcy! But I promise I’ll try to do what I
think is wisest. Are you satisfied now?”
Her aunt assured her that she was. It was
one of those rare and wonderful occasions in
which advice wasn’t resented.
38

The Gardiners, with Jane in tow, left for
London. A few days later, Mr. Collins arrived
at Lucas Lodge. He and his bride-to-be were
going to Kent the next day. Before leaving,
Charlotte came to say goodbye to Elizabeth.
“I have a favor to ask, Elizabeth,” she said.
“Will you come and see me?”
Though she saw little pleasure in the visit,
Elizabeth couldn’t refuse. She agreed to come
in March. Sir William would be coming then,
along with his second-oldest daughter, Maria.
Meanwhile, Elizabeth waited impatiently
for Jane’s letters from London. But Jane’s
news was sad indeed. After a month, she’d
seen nothing of Bingley. She’d paid one visit
to Caroline, but the visit was not returned for
weeks. When Caroline did come at last, she
was not polite. Jane wrote:
I am afraid you are quite correct, dearest
Lizzy. It seems that Caroline has never liked me.
I pity her, but I’m sure that she’s concerned for
her brother. We know that he never really cared
for me, but perhaps she feels differently. Yet I
wonder. If he had cared for me, he would have
visited me long ago. He knows I’m in town, I am

sure. Yet I cannot understand it. I’m almost
tempted to think I have been deceived.
This letter pained Elizabeth. She could no
longer wish that Bingley would see Jane again.
Indeed, the more she thought about it, the
worse his behavior seemed.
January and February passed. Then March
arrived, and Elizabeth left to visit Charlotte.
On the way to Kent, she stopped in London
to see Jane and the Gardiners.
As soon as she could, Elizabeth asked her
aunt how Jane was feeling. She was saddened,
but not surprised, to hear that Jane was often
depressed. Then Mrs. Gardiner asked about
Wickham. Elizabeth told her that he now
seemed interested in someone else. The young
woman’s name was Miss King. Her greatest
charm was having recently inherited ten
thousand pounds! Elizabeth found no fault in
his wish to be independent. Wickham had
touched her heart only lightly. She believed
that she would have been his first choice—if
money had been no object.
Before they left, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner
invited Elizabeth to take a tour with them in
40

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

Page 41

the summer. Nothing could be more agreeable
to Elizabeth. “My dear, dear aunt,” she cried.
“What delight! Goodbye to disappointment.
What are men compared to rocks and
mountains?” She left for Kent in good spirits.
Charlotte welcomed her with great
pleasure. Mr. Collins was in his glory,
pointing out every detail of the fine house.
She wondered how her friend could look so
content. Most of the time, Charlotte wisely
didn’t seem to hear him.
Two days later they were invited to dine at
Rosings, the estate of Lady Catherine. Mr.
Collins’ triumph was complete. As they
entered the house, he pointed out every
magnificent detail. Sir William was awed.
Maria seemed frightened out of her wits.
Elizabeth was calm and curious.
Lady Catherine was a tall, big-boned
woman with strong features. She spoke with
natural authority. Her daughter, Miss de
Bourge, was very small and sickly looking.
Thinking of Darcy, Elizabeth said to herself,
“Oh, yes, she’ll make him a proper wife.”
Dinner was grand indeed. All the servants
41

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

09/6/06

Page 42

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

and all the silverware that Mr. Collins had
promised were there. He complimented Lady
Catherine excessively, and Sir William echoed
him. Lady Catherine was pleased with the
praise. She advised Charlotte about managing
her house, her cows, and her poultry. Then
she turned to Elizabeth. She asked her about
her family, her sisters, and what sort of
carriage her father had. Elizabeth felt the
impertinence of all these questions. But she
answered her politely.
At length, Lady Catherine asked, “Have
any of your younger sisters come out?”
“Yes, ma’am, all of them,” Elizabeth said.
“All! ” Lady Catherine exclaimed. “And the
younger ones are out before the elder ones are
married? How very odd! ”
“If the elder sisters do not marry early,”
Elizabeth answered, “it would be very hard on
the younger ones. Surely, the last born have as
much right to enter society as the first.”
“Upon my word!” Lady Catherine cried.
“You give your opinion very freely for such a
young person. What is your age?”
“With three sisters grown up,” Elizabeth
42

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

09/6/06

Page 43

said with a smile, “your Ladyship can hardly
expect me to tell my age.”
Lady Catherine seemed very surprised at
not receiving a direct answer. “You cannot be
more than twenty, I am sure,” she said.
“I am not twenty-one,” Elizabeth said.
After a very dull game of cards, Elizabeth
was greatly relieved when the evening was
finally over.

Darcy Admits
the Truth

After this, they dined at Lady Catherine’s
estate about twice a week. Elizabeth spent her
days walking and in conversation with
Charlotte. She noticed that Charlotte often
encouraged her husband to spend time out in
the garden, or to go to Rosings without her.
When Elizabeth had been at Charlotte’s
for a fortnight, two visitors arrived at Rosings.
One was Mr. Darcy. The other was another
nephew of Lady Catherine’s. Colonel
Fitzwilliam was not handsome, but he was a
true gentleman. Elizabeth quickly caught his
fancy. The next time Elizabeth came to
Rosings, Colonel Fitzwilliam asked her to
play the pianoforte.
Mr. Darcy drew near to watch her play.
“You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by
coming to hear me. But I am too stubborn for
44

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

09/6/06

2:48 PM

Page 45

that.” Then, turning to Colonel Fitzwilliam,
Elizabeth said, “I can tell you something quite
dreadful about your cousin.”
“Pray, let me hear it,” the Colonel said.
“The first time I ever saw Mr. Darcy was at
a ball,” Elizabeth said. “And what do you
think he did? He danced only four dances!”
Darcy blushed. “But at that time, I didn’t
know any of the ladies there.”
Elizabeth’s eyes twinkled. “True—and
nobody can ever be introduced at a ball,” she
said facetiously.
Darcy was embarrassed. “I find it difficult
to speak with people I’ve never seen before,”
he said. “It’s a talent I don’t seem to have.”
“I don’t have a talent for playing well,”
Elizabeth said. “But I know I could play much
better if I practiced.”
Lady Catherine interrupted, demanding to
know what they were talking about. Elizabeth
immediately began to play.
In the days that followed, the colonel came
to visit Elizabeth often. So did Mr. Darcy. It
was clear why Colonel Fitzwilliam came—he
enjoyed Elizabeth’s company. But it was
45

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

09/6/06

2:48 PM

Page 46

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

difficult to understand why Mr. Darcy came.
He often sat for ten minutes at a time without
opening his mouth.
One day, as Elizabeth walked in the park,
she met Colonel Fitzwilliam. “I’ve heard
you’re planning to leave Kent soon,” she said.
“Yes—if Darcy doesn’t put it off again,”
Colonel Fitzwilliam answered. “He arranges
everything as he pleases.”
“Mr. Darcy seems to find great pleasure in
having his own way,” Elizabeth said.
“We all like to have our own way,” said
Colonel Fitzwilliam. “But it’s easier for him,
because he’s a rich man. I speak as a younger
son who doesn’t get things so easily!”
“In my opinion,” Elizabeth said, “the
younger son of an earl cannot suffer much.”
“But younger sons cannot afford to marry
whomever they like,” Colonel Fitzwilliam said.
Elizabeth blushed. She wondered if he was
talking about her. She answered with a joke,
and he replied in the same manner. After a
silence, Colonel Fitzwilliam mentioned Mr.
Bingley, who he knew a little.
Elizabeth said dryly, “Mr. Darcy seems to
46

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

09/6/06

2:48 PM

Page 47

Darcy Admits the Truth • 7

take great care of Mr. Bingley.”
“I believe Mr. Bingley owes a great deal to
Mr. Darcy,” Colonel Fitzwilliam said.
“What do you mean?” asked Elizabeth.
“Mr. Darcy said he’d saved a friend of his
from a bad marriage,” he said. “I am sure he
was talking about Mr. Bingley.”
“Did Mr. Darcy tell you just why he’d
interfered?” Elizabeth asked.
“It seems there were some very strong
objections against the lady,” he said.
Elizabeth changed the subject. As soon as
she returned to the house, she shut herself in
her room. She’d always thought Caroline was
the one who separated Jane and Bingley. Now
she knew it had been Darcy! The angry tears
that followed brought on a headache. That
evening, they were to have tea at Rosings. But
Elizabeth said she wasn’t well.
After everyone had gone, the doorbell
rang. To Elizabeth’s great surprise, Darcy was
at the door.
He asked about her health. She answered
with cold politeness. He sat down, then got
up and walked about the room. Finally he
47

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

09/6/06

2:48 PM

Page 48

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

said, “This simply won’t do! I have struggled
in vain. Please let me tell you how much I
admire and love you!”
Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond
words. She stared at him in silence.
Darcy admitted that he’d cared for her for
a long time. Then he declared that he loved
her—in spite of her inferior family.
At first, Elizabeth felt honored by his
proposal. She was sorry to hurt Darcy by
refusing him. But when he spoke of her
family, the color rose in her cheeks. “If I could
feel grateful for your offer, I would thank you.
But I cannot,” she said firmly.
Darcy became pale with anger. It was clear
he expected her to accept him. “Could you
perhaps tell me why I was rejected? And with
so little politeness?” he demanded.
“I might as well ask why you chose to
insult me!” she said. “You say that you care for
me against your will. But even if I cared for
you, how could I accept you? You have ruined
my sister’s happiness—perhaps forever. Can
you deny this?”
“I cannot deny it. I did everything in my
48

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

Page 49

power to separate Bingley from your sister.”
“But that’s not the only reason for my
dislike. Wickham has told me how you
treated him. You robbed him of everything
that he deserved.”
“And this,” Darcy cried, “is your opinion
of me! I thank you for explaining it.”
“And it is not only for these reasons that I
dislike you. From the very beginning, I saw
your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish
scorn for the feelings of others. You are the
last man in the world I’d ever marry!”
“You’ve said quite enough, madam,” he
cried. “I understand your feelings perfectly.
Now I’m only ashamed of what mine have
been. Forgive me for taking up so much of
your time. And accept my best wishes for
your health and happiness.”
With these words, he quickly left the house.
She felt too weak to stand. She sat down and
cried for half an hour. When she heard the
carriage outside, she hurried to her room. She
couldn’t face Charlotte—or anyone else.

A Letter for
Elizabeth

The next day, Elizabeth was out walking
alone in the park. She saw Mr. Darcy coming
toward her. Before she could avoid him, he
came up to her and said, “I was hoping to see
you, Elizabeth. Will you do me the honor of
reading this letter?”
When she took the letter, he bowed at the
waist and turned away. The letter read:
Do not be alarmed, madam, on receiving
this letter. It does not contain another offer of
marriage. But I do ask your attention—and
your sense of justice.
You have charged me with two different
offenses. One charge concerns your sister. The
other concerns Mr. Wickham. I will answer the
charge regarding your sister first:
Soon after Bingley met your sister, I could tell
50

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

09/6/06

2:48 PM

Page 51

A Letter for Elizabeth • 8

he had serious feelings for her. Yet, although your
sister seemed to like him, it seemed to me that
her heart was not touched. If I was mistaken,
I’m sorry I gave her pain.
I did object to Bingley marrying your sister
because of your family. I find no fault in the way
you and Jane behave. But the behavior of your
mother and your younger sisters shows a total
lack of propriety. To me, this is far worse than
your family’s lack of a fortune. Forgive me for
saying this—it pains me to offend you.
Bingley’s sisters were also worried about their
brother’s attraction to Miss Bennet. The three of
us tried to persuade him not to marry Miss
Bennet. This alone would not have discouraged
him. His feelings were very strong. But we
convinced him that your sister didn’t really care
for him. This wasn’t difficult, as Bingley is a
very modest man.
There’s one part of this affair that shames me.
I knew your sister was in London, but I kept this
fact from Bingley. At that time, I felt this was
for the best.
As for Mr. Wickham, I can answer this
charge in only one way: You must know the
51

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

09/6/06

2:48 PM

Page 52

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

entire truth of his connection to my family.
Being very fond of Wickham, my father wished
to provide him with a living when he died.
Wickham told me he had decided not to join the
clergy. By this time, I knew his character well. I
agreed that he should not be a clergyman.
Instead, he planned to become a lawyer. He
asked for money, and I gave him three thousand
pounds. Instead of studying law, he spent it all
on other things. Then, when the living became
vacant, he demanded it for himself. This time,
however, I refused to help him. His anger
against me was strong indeed.
I saw no more of Wickham until last
summer. What happened at that time is painful
for me to tell. I have no doubt of your secrecy in
this matter. After the death of my father, Colonel
Fitzwilliam and I were named guardians of
Georgiana, my younger sister. She was living in
London last summer with her governess, Mrs.
Younge. Unfortunately, we didn’t know that
Mrs. Younge was a friend of Wickham. Without
my knowledge, Wickham began to visit
Georgiana. He convinced her that he was in love
with her and persuaded her to elope. She was
52

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

A Letter for Elizabeth • 8

only 15 at the time, which must be her excuse.
But she couldn’t bear to hurt me, so she told me
her plans. Luckily, I was able to stop the
elopement before it took place. Wickham was
caught, and Mrs. Younge was fired. I am sure
Wickham’s chief object was my sister’s fortune,
which is 30 thousand pounds. I believe he also
wanted revenge on me. The revenge he planned
would have been complete indeed!
If you doubt what I am saying, you may ask
Colonel Fitzwilliam. I will try to put this letter
into your hands before he leaves. I will only add,
God bless you.
Fitzwilliam Darcy
At first, Elizabeth had a strong prejudice
against everything Darcy said. His words
showed nothing but pride.
But then she came to the part about Mr.
Wickham. She could hardly believe what she
read. “This cannot be!” She said to herself.
“Mr. Darcy must be lying!”
She read the entire letter, and put it away.
She decided she would never look at it again.
Half a minute later, however, she read the
53

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

09/6/06

Page 54

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

letter again. She began to think about
Wickham. She realized she’d known nothing
of his past. She remembered his charming
manner perfectly. Yet she could not recall
anything good or kind he’d done. She decided
against talking to Colonel Fitzwilliam. Darcy
wouldn’t have mentioned him if his story had
been false.
Wickham had said that he’d never slander
Darcy, because he’d loved Darcy’s father. But
as soon as Darcy left for London, he’d told
everyone his story. His slander, in fact, had
destroyed Darcy’s reputation.
She remembered that people close to
Darcy thought highly of him. Even Wickham
had praised him as a devoted brother.
As she thought it over, Elizabeth became
ashamed of herself. She’d been blind and
prejudiced about both men!
Elizabeth read the first part of the letter
again. She had to give Darcy credit for his
observations of Jane. Although her feelings
had been deep, Jane didn’t show them. Now
Elizabeth believed that Bingley had never
known Jane was in London. Darcy’s letter
54

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

Page 55

cleared Bingley of all blame. She felt heartsick
at what Jane had lost.
When Elizabeth re-read the part about her
family, she felt great shame. Her younger
sisters were ignorant and foolish! Lydia would
flirt with any officer in her sight, and Kitty
followed wherever Lydia led. Her foolish
mother only encouraged them by behaving
just as poorly. And instead of correcting his
daughters, her father made great sport of
laughing at them.
Now Elizabeth realized what her family’s
55

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

Page 56

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

behavior had done. It had hurt both her and
Jane’s chances for marriage! She suddenly felt
very depressed.
A few days later, it was time to return
home. Lady Catherine paid a last visit to the
Collinses. The bossy woman gave them very
detailed instructions how to pack. Maria felt
that she must have done a very poor job the
first time. She re-packed her entire trunk!
As Elizabeth said goodbye to Miss de
Bourge and Lady Catherine, she smiled. What
if she had accepted Mr. Darcy? She wondered
how Lady Catherine would have reacted.
Elizabeth felt sad to leave Charlotte with
such a husband as Mr. Collins. Yet she’d
chosen him with her eyes open. And—for
now—she seemed to be content.
As they drove off, Maria exclaimed, “We
have dined nine times with Lady Catherine! I
shall have so much to tell!”
“Yes—and I shall have so much to keep
secret,” Elizabeth thought to herself.

Changes
Her Mind

When Elizabeth finally saw Jane alone, she
told her everything—except what she had
learned about Bingley. Seeing that Jane loved
him still, she wanted to spare her feelings.
But what a blow for Jane to hear about
Wickham! It was hard for her to believe that
anyone could be so wicked.
“I want your advice on one point,” she
said. “Should we tell people what we know
about Wickham? Lydia says his regiment will
leave for Brighton soon. Perhaps I should say
nothing about him.”
“I think you’re quite right,” Elizabeth
agreed. “He may be very sorry for what he’s
done. No doubt he’s trying to improve.”
Wickham did leave for Brighton. Elizabeth
was delighted to see him go. But Kitty and
Lydia were miserable that the regiment had
57

gone. “What’s to become of us?” they wailed.
Lydia’s gloom, however, was soon cleared
away. She was invited to Brighton to stay with
Mrs. Forster, the young wife of the regiment’s
colonel. In the last couple of months, she and
Lydia had become close friends. Lydia was in
ecstasy.
Elizabeth secretly advised her father not to
let Lydia go to Brighton. She worried that her
sister would become even wilder when she
was alone and away from home.
Mr. Bennet only laughed at her. “But we
shall have no peace if Lydia does not go to
Brighton! Luckily, she is too poor for any man
to take advantage of her.”
Elizabeth had to be satisfied with this
answer. Lydia left soon after the regiment.
With the officers gone, there were fewer
parties. The summer passed slowly. Elizabeth
waited impatiently to begin her travels with
the Gardiners.
Finally, in mid-July, her aunt and uncle
arrived. As their trip began, they traveled to
many parts of Derbyshire, enjoying each
other’s company thoroughly. August found

them in the little town of Lambton, staying at
an inn. Lambton, Elizabeth learned, was only
five miles from Pemberly. Years ago, Mrs.
Gardiner had visited Pemberly, and now she
wished to visit it again.
Pemberly—the Darcy estate! Just the
possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy at Pemberly
made Elizabeth blush. It would be dreadful!
She decided to speak openly to her aunt. But
then she learned that Mr. Darcy would be
away from Pemberly for the summer. So off
they went to Pemberly.
Her spirits were in high flutter as the
carriage drove toward Pemberly House. It was
a large and handsome stone building, with a
stream in front. They were greeted by the
housekeeper. She was an elderly woman, and
very respectable looking.
After welcoming them, the housekeeper
led them on a tour of the house. Elizabeth was
lost in admiration. The rooms were handsome
indeed and decorated in fine taste.
“And I might have been mistress of this
place!” Elizabeth thought. “But, no, my dear
aunt and uncle would then have been lost to
59

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

me. Mr. Darcy would have never allowed
them to visit here.”
At one point, the housekeeper pointed out
a drawing of Mr. Darcy. “And this,” she said
proudly, “is my master.”
“You seem to be quite proud of him,”
Elizabeth said.
“He is the best master who ever lived!” the
housekeeper said. “He’s not like most of the
wild young men nowadays—who think of
nothing but themselves! Not one of his
servants will give him a bad name. Some
people call him proud, but I’m sure I never
saw anything of it. They say that only because
he doesn’t chatter away as some men do!”
Elizabeth’s view of Mr. Darcy softened.
“Can this be the real Mr. Darcy?” she
wondered. The housekeeper’s praise was no
small matter. What praise is more valuable
than that of an intelligent servant?
When they finished looking at the house,
they walked outside. Just as they did, a young
man came around the corner. It was none
other than Mr. Darcy!
He seemed frozen in surprise. He and
60

Elizabeth blushed and stared at each other.
Then he stepped forward and politely
asked about her family.
Elizabeth’s embarrassment was extreme.
Yet she wondered at how changed he was.
Never had he seemed so gentle. In spite of
everything, she longed to know if he still
loved her.
When he asked her to introduce him to
the Gardiners, she could hardly keep from
smiling. Here was her family, which he had
scorned. Yet now Darcy was all courtesy.
Elizabeth was pleased as he spoke to her
uncle. Here, at least, were family members
who would not make her blush. Everything
her uncle said showed his intelligence and
good manners.
Before leaving, Elizabeth told Darcy that
she’d not expected him to be at Pemberly.
He replied that he’d been traveling ahead of
his party. Then he added, “There’s one person
in the party who especially wants to meet you,
Elizabeth. Will you allow me to introduce you
to my sister?”
Elizabeth was flattered and pleased. This
61

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

09/6/06

2:49 PM

Page 62

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

was a compliment of the highest kind!
The next day, Mr. Darcy and his sister
came to visit Elizabeth at the inn.
Georgiana Darcy was a great surprise to
Elizabeth. She seemed as embarrassed as
Elizabeth. Wickham had said Miss Darcy was
very proud. Instead, she was quite shy.
Mr. Darcy told Elizabeth that Bingley was
also coming. In a few minutes, they heard his
quick step on the stairs. On seeing Bingley,
Elizabeth’s thoughts flew to her sister. She
watched him speak to Miss Darcy, who was
supposed to be Jane’s rival. But Elizabeth saw
no attraction between them.
After going to bed that night, Elizabeth lay
awake for hours. She tried to decide how she
felt about Mr. Darcy. Her feelings of strong
dislike had disappeared. Now she felt very
grateful. It seemed he loved her still! She
respected him and had an interest in his
happiness. If she chose, she felt she still had
the power to make him happy.
The next day, they were invited to dine at
Pemberly. All eyes were on Darcy and
Elizabeth. No one watched them more closely
62

than Caroline Bingley. Hoping to put
Elizabeth in a bad light, Caroline asked, “The
soldiers have left Meryton, have they not? It
must be a great loss to your family.”
Caroline didn’t mention Wickham’s name,
but Elizabeth felt distressed. While she
answered calmly, she glanced over at Darcy.
Embarrassed, he earnestly studied her face.
Georgiana seemed much too overcome with
embarrassment to look at anyone. Caroline
had no idea that she was hurting Georgiana
far more than Elizabeth!
When Elizabeth left, Caroline remarked,
“How very poorly Elizabeth Bennet looked.
But I never could see any beauty in her!”
Jealous people are not always wise. She
looked at Darcy. “I believe you thought her
rather pretty at one time.”
“Yes, but that was only when I first knew
her,” Darcy replied. “Now I believe she’s one
of the prettiest women I’ve ever met!”
He then left. Caroline Bingley had forced
him to hurt no one but herself.

A Family
Scandal

Elizabeth had been waiting impatiently for
a letter from Jane. Finally, two letters arrived
on the same day. While her aunt and uncle were
out, Elizabeth opened the first one. It read:
Dearest Lizzy:
Something very serious has happened. Please
don’t be alarmed—we are all well. What I have
to tell you concerns poor Lydia. An express letter
came last night from Colonel Forster. Lydia has
eloped with one of his officers—Wickham! I’m
sorry for Lydia. But at least he isn’t marrying her
out of greed. He must know that father can give
her nothing. I must go, for I cannot leave poor
mother alone for long.
The next letter had been written a day
later. It read:
64

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

09/6/06

2:49 PM

Page 65

A Family Scandal • 10

Dearest Lizzy:
I hardly know what to write. We’re not
certain that Lydia and Wickham have been
married at all! A friend of Wickham’s has
confessed to Colonel Forster that Wickham had
no intention of marrying her. Father and
Mother fear the worst. I can hardly believe it,
but Colonel Forster says Wickham is not a man
to be trusted. As far as we can tell, they went to
London. Colonel Forster and Father are in
London now, trying to find them. I hope our
uncle will be kind enough to join them. I beg
you, dearest Lizzy, to return home as soon as
possible.
When she finished reading, Elizabeth
darted from her seat. “Oh, where is my
uncle?” she cried. As she reached the door, it
was opened by a servant. Mr. Darcy stepped
inside.
Her pale face shocked him. “Good God!
What’s the matter?” he cried out.
“I’ve had some dreadful news from home,”
she said before bursting into tears. For a few
minutes she couldn’t speak. Finally, she went
65

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

09/6/06

2:49 PM

Page 66

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

on. “This news cannot be kept secret from
anyone. My youngest sister, Lydia, has run
off—with Mr. Wickham! You know him too
well to doubt the rest.”
Darcy stared in astonishment. “I’m
grieved—shocked!” he exclaimed. “What has
been done to find her?”
“My father has gone to London,” she said.
“Jane has written to ask our uncle’s help. But
I have no hope. What can we do with a man
like Wickham? It is horrible!”
Darcy hardly seemed to hear her. He
walked up and down the room. A gloomy
expression was on his face. Now Elizabeth
understood her own feelings. Now—when it
was hopeless—she realized how much she
could have loved him!
Soon after Darcy said goodbye, her aunt
and uncle returned. Trembling, Elizabeth read
them the letters. Her uncle quickly offered to
help. An hour later, they were seated in the
carriage, headed toward the Bennets’ house.
As they rode, Elizabeth’s thoughts turned
to Lydia again and again. She’d never noticed
that Lydia had preferred Wickham to any of
66

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

09/6/06

2:49 PM

Page 67

A Family Scandal • 10

the other officers. Sometimes one officer,
sometimes another had been her favorite. It
seemed that poor Lydia was eager to attach
herself to anybody!
Arriving at home, Elizabeth found her
mother in bed. Mrs. Bennet greeted them
with noisy tears. She blamed everyone but
herself for Lydia’s fate. “I am sure the Forsters
neglected poor Lydia,” she said. “She’s not the
kind of child to do such a thing. Poor girl!
Oh, I have such tremblings all over me. And
pains in my head. I cannot rest by night or
day. And now Mr. Bennet’s gone away. I know
that he will fight Wickham. If he’s killed,
what will become of us?”
Everyone tried to calm her down. Mr.
Gardiner assured her that he would travel to
London the very next day.
Later, Jane showed Elizabeth the letter
Lydia had written to Mrs. Forster. It read:
You’ll laugh tomorrow when you know where
I’ve gone. I cannot help laughing myself to
imagine your surprise tomorrow morning. I’m
going to be married! And if you cannot guess
67

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

Page 68

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

who I’m marrying, I shall think you a simpleton!
If you don’t want to, you needn’t send word to
my family. It will be an even bigger surprise
when I write to them—and sign my name Lydia
Wickham!
“Oh, thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!”
Elizabeth cried out. “But at least this shows
she was serious about getting married. Our
poor father! How he must have felt!”
“I never saw anyone look quite so
shocked,” Jane said. “For ten minutes or so,
he couldn’t speak a word.”
They waited anxiously for a letter from
Mr. Bennet. Instead, a letter addressed to him
arrived from Mr. Collins. Jane had received
directions to open all of her father’s mail. She
opened the letter and read:
I feel I must comfort your family during this
sad time. Your distress must be of the worst
kind—for time will not heal it! Indeed, the
death of your daughter would be a blessing
compared to this scandal. It must be especially
painful for you, since it is clear you’ve been too
68

lenient with her. All of us, including Lady
Catherine, agree that you deserve our pity. But
such a false step by one daughter will hurt all of
them! For who would connect themselves with
such a family? Let me advise you, dear sir, to cut
off all your affection for this unworthy child.
The next letter they received was from Mr.
Gardiner. He told them Wickham had left
Brighton because of his many gambling debts.
He owed more than a thousand pounds! Mr.
Gardiner then added that Lydia’s father had
become discouraged in his search. He’d be
arriving home soon.
Mrs. Bennet was not so concerned for her
husband’s safety as before. “What!” she cried.
“Coming home without Lydia? Who will
fight Wickham and force him to marry her?”
Mr. Bennet was in a dark mood when he
returned home. Elizabeth tried to comfort
him, but he said, “For once in my life, Lizzy,
let me feel how much I’m to blame. But I’m
not afraid of being overpowered with my
guilt. It will pass away soon enough.”

Lydia’s
Return

Two days after Mr. Bennet returned home,
he received a letter from Mr. Gardiner. After
reading it, he went out walking. When
Elizabeth and Jane found him, he handed the
letter to Elizabeth. She read:
At last I have news of my niece. I have seen
them both. They are not yet married. But if you
consent to the following agreement, I hope they
will be soon. All that is required is Lydia’s share
of her inheritance and one hundred pounds a
year. Send back an answer as soon as you can.
Mr. Bennet shook his head sadly. “No man
in his senses would marry Lydia for so little!”
he said. “I need to know how much money
your uncle has given Wickham. How am I
ever going to repay him?”
70

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

09/6/06

2:49 PM

Page 71

Lydia’s Return • 11

Unlike her husband, Mrs. Bennet was
joyful. It had been a fortnight since she’d
come downstairs. But that night, she took her
seat at the head of the table. “My dear, dear
Lydia!” she cried. “Married at sixteen! How I
long to see her—and dear Wickham, too!
Now she must have clothes and servants. And
she must not live more than 10 miles away. I
couldn’t bear it.”
Mr. Bennet let her talk while the servants
were present. But when they left, he said,
“Mrs. Bennet, wherever they live, there is one
house they will never enter—this one.”
A long argument followed, but Mr. Bennet
was firm. He refused to give Lydia a single
pound for clothes.
As Elizabeth listened, she thought of Mr.
Darcy. Now she was sorry she’d told him
about Lydia and Wickham. Yet the situation
was hopeless. How could Darcy ever join a
family that included Wickham?
She finally understood that she and Darcy
would have suited each other perfectly. Her
liveliness would have softened his stiff
manner. His judgment and knowledge of the
71

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

Page 72

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

world would have improved her mind.
Mr. Gardiner wrote once more to say the
marriage would take place in a few days.
Wickham would be joining the army and
then be moving north. Before he left, he and
Lydia hoped to visit the family.
Jane and Elizabeth felt that Lydia should
be allowed to visit. They urged Mr. Bennet so
earnestly that he finally agreed.
Wickham and Lydia came. Lydia was the
same as ever—noisy, wild, and fearless. She
demanded congratulations from everyone.
Wickham, too, showed no sign of shame for
what he’d done.
Elizabeth was disgusted. She quickly saw
that Lydia cared more for Wickham than he
did for her. Why had he run away with her at
all? But then she remembered that he’d left
Brighton because of his debts. Her uncle must
have given him money!
Soon after her arrival, Lydia insisted on
telling Elizabeth and Jane about the wedding.
“We were to be at the church at eleven
o’clock,” she said. “Then my uncle was called
away on business. I was afraid he’d be late.
72

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

09/6/06

2:49 PM

Page 73

Lydia’s Return • 11

But then I remembered that Mr. Darcy could
have taken his place—”
“Mr. Darcy! ” Elizabeth cried out.
“Oh!” Lydia cried out. “That was supposed
to be a secret!”
“Don’t say another word,” Jane said.
Elizabeth was burning with curiosity. As
soon as she was alone, she wrote to her aunt.
She asked why Mr. Darcy had been at Lydia’s
wedding.
Her aunt very quickly sent a reply. Mr.
Darcy had gone to visit Mrs. Younge,
Georgiana’s former governess. At first, Mrs.
Younge refused to say a word. But eventually
Darcy was able to find out where the couple
was staying. After meeting with Wickham
several times, Darcy worked out an agreement
with him—by paying for everything.
The letter confused Elizabeth. Her heart
said that Darcy had done it all for her. But her
head couldn’t believe it.
Meanwhile, Mrs. Bennet had news that
Bingley was returning to Netherfield Hall.
“As soon as Bingley comes,” she said to her
husband, “you must visit him.”
73

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

09/6/06

2:49 PM

Page 74

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

Mr. Bennet refused.
But this time, it was Mr. Bingley who
came to visit. Mr. Darcy was with him. Mrs.
Bennet was overly gracious to Mr. Bingley—
and rude to Mr. Darcy. Jane managed to be
calm, but Elizabeth was very uneasy. She
waited to see how Darcy would behave.
Darcy was nearly silent for the entire visit.
“Why did he come?” Elizabeth wondered.
Jane was happier than she dared to admit.
A few days later, Bingley came again, alone.
With high hopes, Mrs. Bennet called Mary,
Elizabeth, and Kitty upstairs. As soon as Jane
and Bingley were alone, he proposed.
When he left, Jane came to Elizabeth,
glowing with joy. “It is too much!” she said.
“Far too much. Oh, Elizabeth! I don’t deserve
such happiness!”
Elizabeth thought to herself, “So this is the
end of all Darcy’s worrying and Caroline’s
lies. What a happy ending, indeed!”

Three Married
Daughters

About a week after Bingley and Jane were
engaged, Elizabeth had a visitor—Lady
Catherine de Bourge. After greeting Mrs.
Bennet quite ungraciously, Lady Catherine
demanded to see Elizabeth alone.
“You must know why I’ve come,” she said.
Elizabeth was astonished. “Indeed, I do
not, madam.”
Lady Catherine looked very angry. “Miss
Bennet,” she said. “I will not be trifled with.
Two days ago I learned that you were engaged
to my nephew, Mr. Darcy. I’m certain this
must be an outrageous lie. But still, I had to
find out for myself.”
“If you believe it to be impossible, I
wonder why you took the trouble of coming
so far,” Elizabeth said.
“Can you tell me there’s no truth to this
75

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

09/6/06

Page 76

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

outrageous lie?” Lady Catherine demanded.
“I will not be as frank as your Ladyship,”
Elizabeth said coolly. “You ask questions I
may not choose to answer.”
“You must tell me once and for all—are
you engaged to Mr. Darcy?” Lady Catherine
snapped.
“I am not,” Elizabeth said firmly.
“And will you promise never to enter into
such an engagement?” said Lady Catherine.
“No, I’ll make no promise of the kind,”
Elizabeth answered.
Lady Catherine stormed off angrily.
A few days later, Bingley came to visit with
Mr. Darcy. Wishing to be alone with Jane, he
suggested a walk. Soon he and Jane were
lagging behind Elizabeth and Darcy. “You are
too kind to trifle with me,” Darcy said. “If
you feel about me as you did last year, please
tell me so at once. My feelings for you are
unchanged. But just one word from you will
silence me forever.”
Then Elizabeth shyly told him that her
feelings had changed completely.
Her words made him happier than he’d

ever been before! Then he told her how much
he cared for her. She was unable to look at
him, but she listened closely. Everything he
said made his love more valuable.
They walked on without knowing where
they were going. As they talked, she learned
that she owed all her happiness to Lady
Catherine! She’d immediately gone to Darcy
after leaving the Bennets’ house.
“What Lady Catherine said allowed me to
hope,” Darcy said. “I knew you would have
told her frankly if you didn’t care for me.”
“Yes, you know enough of my frankness,”
Elizabeth said, blushing. “I was horrible to
you when you first proposed.”
“I deserved everything you said to me,”
Darcy insisted. “When I was growing up, I
was spoiled by my good parents. I’m afraid I
became conceited and proud. Oh, my dearest,
loveliest Elizabeth! You taught me a valuable
lesson. How much I owe you! I’ve tried hard
to change ever since I met you.”
“And one of these changes was to allow
Mr. Bingley to marry Jane?” Elizabeth asked.
“Allow! ” Mr. Darcy cried. “Let me tell you
77

0-QX-Pride and Prejudice-Final

what happened. I confessed everything to
Bingley. I admitted that I’d known your sister
was in town, and kept it from him! He was
angry, as I well deserved. But he forgave me
anyway. Once I convinced him of your sister’s
love, he was too happy to be angry.”
Elizabeth smiled at how easily Darcy had
directed his friend. But she said nothing.
Darcy had not yet learned to be the target of
laughter. It was rather too early to begin.
They walked for miles because there was so
much to say and to feel! Then at last, all was
settled between them. Now the happy news
must be shared with her family.
First, Elizabeth told Jane and then her
father. They could scarcely believe her. It took
Elizabeth some time to explain her change of
heart. Then she told them what Darcy had
done for Lydia.
Her mother needed no explanations.
When Elizabeth told her of the engagement,
she sat quite still, unable to say a word. Then
she got up, sat down, and blessed herself.
Finally, Mrs. Bennet said, “Good gracious!
Mr. Darcy! Oh, my sweetest Lizzy! How rich
78

and how great you will be! Such a charming
man! So handsome! So tall! Please let me
apologize for disliking him so much before
now. Oh, my! Three daughters married! Ten
thousand a year! Bless me!”
****
Her three daughters’ marriages did not
change Mrs. Bennet’s character, however. She
was still often nervous and always silly.
After Elizabeth’s marriage, Mr. Bennet
missed her very much. He took great delight
in visiting Pemberly, however—especially
when he was not expected.
Jane and Bingley remained at Netherfield a
year and then moved to Derbyshire. Jane and
Elizabeth were now only 30 miles apart,
which added to their happiness.
Kitty visited her older sisters often. Over
time, her character was greatly improved by
their company. Lydia invited her also, but Mr.
Bennet always forbade it. Mary remained at
home, for her mother couldn’t bear to be
without a daughter’s company.
Mr. Wickham was never allowed to visit
Pemberly. But Elizabeth often sent money to

him and Lydia, since they always seemed to
need it! For Elizabeth’s sake, Darcy also
helped Wickham in his profession.
Georgiana Darcy now lived at Pemberly.
She and Elizabeth grew to love each other. At
first, Georgiana was astonished at the lively
way Elizabeth spoke to her older brother. But
she learned that a woman may take liberties
with her husband.
Miss Bingley was mortified by Darcy’s
marriage. But she was very fond of Georgiana.
Therefore, she was always very polite to
Elizabeth when she visited Pemberly.
Lady Catherine was still upset with Darcy.
She sent him a letter saying exactly what she
thought of his marriage—and his wife. For a
time, Darcy wouldn’t write to her or visit
Rosings. But Elizabeth eventually persuaded
him to reconcile with her.
The Gardiners visited Pemberly often.
Darcy and Elizabeth loved them. They never
forgot that it was the Gardiners who had
brought them together!

Silly Mrs. Bennet is “husband hunting”
for her five daughters. Heaven knows it
isn’t easy! Darcy would make a great
match for Elizabeth—if it weren’t for his
false pride and her stubborn prejudice.
And the other girls aren’t cooperating,
either. Jane is too shy to show affection, and
Lydia has run off with an unsuitable army
officer! What’s a poor mother to do?
